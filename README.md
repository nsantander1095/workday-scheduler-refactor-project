# Description

[Link to live site.]()

The workday scheudler is now a functioning scheduler that runs between the time 9am and 5pm. You can write indivudal scheduled events in the boxes provided and they will be saved to local storage. All of those individual events are colorcoded so that the events show gray when past, red when present, and green for in the future. Further, the scheduler displays the current day and time based on where you are.
